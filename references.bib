By prioritizing geometric intuition, algorithmic thinking, and practical real world applications in disciplines including computer vision, natural language processing, economics, neuroscience, recommender systems, physics, and biology, this text provides readers with both a lucid understanding of foundational material as well as the practical tools needed to solve real-world problems. With in-depth Python and MATLAB/OCTAVE-based computational exercises and a complete treatment of cutting edge numerical optimization techniques, this is an essential resource for students and an ideal reference for researchers and practitioners working in machine learning, computer science, electrical engineering, signal processing, and numerical optimization"--},

	abstract = {We propose a data mining approach to predict human wine taste preferences that is based on easily available analytical tests at the certification step. A large dataset (when compared to other studies in this domain) is considered, with white and red vinho verde samples (from Portugal). Three regression techniques were applied, under a computationally efficient procedure that performs simultaneous variable and model selection. The support vector machine achieved promising results, outperforming the multiple regression and neural network methods. Such model is useful to support the oenologist wine tasting evaluations and improve wine production. Furthermore, similar techniques can help in target marketing by modeling consumer tastes from niche markets.},
